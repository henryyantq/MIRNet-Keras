# MIRNet-Keras for Low Light Enhancement
A modified copy of MIRNet implementation for low light enhancement from [keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mirnet/).

The model was officially announced by Zamir _et al._ in [_Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06792) acccepted by ECCV 2020.
